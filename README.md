**Purpose**

To bring/deploy ML models on Apple platforms (MacOS/IOS) with CoreML.

Supported Models:
* GPT-2    (completed)
* BERT     (on going)
* Llama    (on going)
* Mistral  (future)

**Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Swift**
===============================================================================
**GPT-2 and DistilGPT-2 for Text Generation**
-----------------------------------------

* Chat application
* Converted from PyTorch trained to CoreML models.
* The GPT-2 GenAI, including:
	+ Decoding strategies (greedy and TopK currently implemented).
	+ GPT-2 Byte-pair encoder and decoder.

**Requirements**
------------

* Swift 5.9 or later.
* Xcode 15.4 or later (for macOS development).
* Python 3.7 or later (for PyTorch model conversion).

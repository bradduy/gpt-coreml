**Purpose**

To bring/deploy ML models on Apple platforms (MacOS/IOS) with CoreML.

Supported Models:
* GPT-2    (completed)
* BERT     (on going)
* Llama    (on going)
* Mistral  (future)

**Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Swift**
===============================================================================
**GPT-2 and DistilGPT-2 for Text Generation**
-----------------------------------------

* Chat application
* Converted from PyTorch trained to CoreML models.
* The GPT-2 GenAI, including:
	+ Decoding strategies (greedy and TopK currently implemented).
	+ GPT-2 Byte-pair encoder and decoder.

**Requirements**
------------

* Swift 5.9 or later.
* Xcode 15.4 or later (for macOS development).
* Python 3.7 or later (for PyTorch model conversion).

**Getting Started**
---------------

To get started with this repository, clone it and explore the different folders and files. Each folder contains its own README file with more detailed information on how to use the models and tools.
